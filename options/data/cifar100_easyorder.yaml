# Orders were taken from the ones randomly sampled by iCaRL.
# Results can be very different depending on the class ordering, thus reproducing
# results based on those of iCaRL seems a good idea, as many following papers did.

# It's worth evaluating the algorithm with a fixed seed though, in order to
